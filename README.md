 
 **GeminiAtlas** is the current title.
> **Model & data backends.** Model work runs through the **Remote Service Gateway (RSG)** — no Internet Access capability or on‑device API keys: Momo and the battle host speak on **Gemini Live**, and image understanding plus battle‑question generation use **OpenAI** (vision + gpt‑4o). Battle questions are **card‑driven** (captured cards via gpt‑4o, then baked premade questions), with **Snap Cloud / Supabase** as an emergency fallback question source. The two‑player session runs on **SpectaclesSyncKit**. See *Data sources* and *Battle mode*.

## The three pillars

### I — Capture & learn

On launch, Momo greets you by voice and helps you choose interests (or you tap them on a honeycomb panel). A **two‑hand pinch‑and‑pan** crops whatever's in front of you; an OpenAI vision model captions it into a short, surprising factoid framed through your chosen interests, ending in a topic hashtag. The card's border flows a rainbow while Momo is "thinking," then eases to the topic's color once the subject is known. You can then talk to Momo about any card to ask follow‑ups or edit its text by voice.

### II — Explore & remember

Everything is location‑based and meant to be shared. A **prayer/clap gesture** "discovers the world": a Death‑Stranding‑style ping scan sweeps your space and reveals a cosmos of cards left by you and others, popping into being on the wavefront. Gaze at one to expand it; like, comment (which hands the card to Momo), share, or delete it. Pull up an **interactive Earth globe** to see where your cards came from — select a city and the globe *dives*, becoming a pannable, multi‑resolution holodeck street map. Browse everything as **flashcard decks**, or just ask Momo by voice ("find my cards from Tokyo about botany") and let it fly the globe there and fan the matches into a CoverFlow deck.

### III — Battle

Two players go head‑to‑head in a trivia battle built from their **merged card pools**. A sassy, audio‑only AI game‑show host reads each question aloud and reacts to your play — easing off when you're losing, getting spicier when you're ahead. Classic game‑show rules: the faster player answers first; a correct answer scores and skips to the next question; a wrong answer loses points and hands the opponent a chance; then the correct answer is revealed.

## System architecture

GeminiAtlas is many subsystems that mostly coordinate through a set of `global.*` singletons, so prefab‑instantiated objects can reach shared state without scene wiring.

### Global singletons

| Global | Owner | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `global.cropInterestStore` | `InterestStore` | Session‑scoped selected interest topics. |
| `global.cropCardStore` | `CardStore` | Every card in memory — premade seed + this session's captures. |
| `global.hostVoice` | `WelcomeVoice` | Momo's welcome session; other voices poll it so they never open a competing RSG session. |
| `global.nudgeVoice` | `NudgeVoice` | The lazy gesture‑reminder narrator. |
| `global.topicPanel` | `TopicSelectionPanel` | The launch topic picker (driven by the host's tools). |
| `global.recommendationCards` | `RecommendationCards` | The post‑onboarding "places for you" cards + AR arrow. |
| `global.recommendationVoiceAgent` | `RecommendationVoiceAgent` | Voice that presents/selects the recommendation cards. |
| `global.cardVoiceAgent` | `CardVoiceAgent` | Conversational agent for a single card (with voice editing). |
| `global.cardQueryVoiceAgent` | `CardQueryVoiceAgent` | Voice search over the card cosmos. |
| `global.agentSphere` | `AgentSphere` | Momo's audio envelope + visual orb. |
| `global.agentSubtitle` | `AgentSubtitle` | Live, typed‑out captions of Momo's speech. |
| `global.battleHostVoice` | `BattleHostVoice` | The Battle game‑show host. |
| `global.worldDiscovered` | `PrayerGestureBehavior` | Set true on first discovery; suppresses the nudge. |
| `global.globeController` | `GlobeController` | The globe/map state machine; driven by the query agent. |
| `global.sceneSwitcher` | `SceneSwitcherPanel` | Radio‑style scene/group toggling. |

### Voices & Momo's presence (GeminiAtlas Live via RSG)

All conversational agents connect to **Gemini Live through RSG**. Generated speech streams back as **24 kHz PCM** through a `DynamicAudioOutput` (each voice gets its own to avoid conflicts); mic input flows through one **shared** `MicrophoneAudioProvider`. Because the gateway keeps **only the newest live session alive**, the voices hand the single slot between each other rather than running at once.

| Script | Role |
|---|---|
| `WelcomeVoice` | Momo's two‑way welcome host: generates a greeting, listens, and calls the topic tools to pick interests / start. Persona is pinned in code to keep it "Momo," never "GeminiAtlas." |
| `NudgeVoice` | Audio‑only narrator that lazily connects ~60 s in to remind you of the discovery gesture, then disconnects; suppressed once the world is discovered. |
| `RecommendationVoiceAgent` | After Start, takes the slot from the host to present the three recommendation cards and select one by voice. |
| `CardVoiceAgent` + `CardEditTools` | Conversational agent for the card you're looking at; `CardEditTools` holds the Gemini‑free tool declarations + exact text transforms for voice caption editing. |
| `CardQueryVoiceAgent` + `QueryOrchestrator` | Voice search over the cosmos; the orchestrator (Gemini‑free) filters `CardStore`, drives the cosmos `CardDeckController`, and steers the globe through a per‑frame intent state machine. |
| `TopicAgentTools` | The deterministic, Gemini‑free `select_topics` / `deselect_topics` / `start_exploring` declarations + dispatch that drive `TopicSelectionPanel`. |
| `VoiceBargeIn` | Shared interruption handling: on a Gemini interrupt it flushes buffered playback and silences the orb so Momo stops mid‑sentence. |
| `MicHealth` | Recovers and arbitrates the single shared mic (`safeStartRecording` cycles stop→start, `acquireMic` claims it exclusively, a watchdog re‑cycles a dead provider with backoff). |
| `AgentSphere` | `global.agentSphere`: schedules PCM frames by real playback time so the envelope tracks audible speech; positions the orb in the FoV; exposes `getAudioLevel()` / `interruptAudio()`. |
| `AgentRing` + `AgentNoiseDisc` | The orb's "agent ring": three additive Perlin‑distorted CMY rings that bloom colored fringes with loudness, plus idle‑animated eyes (see `AgentVisual/README.md`). |
| `AgentSubtitle` | `global.agentSubtitle`: a world‑space caption that types out in sync with the voice, two‑line row‑rolling, placed beside the orb or under the active card. |

### Capture pipeline

| Script | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `CameraService` | Camera access for capture. |
| `CropRegion` / `PictureController` | The two‑hand crop selection and capture orchestration. |
| `PictureBehavior` | A captured card's lifecycle (crop → AI caption → topic); `getResolvedTopics()` returns `null` (capturing), `[]` (undecidable), or `[topic, …]`. |
| `ChatGPT` | OpenAI vision captioning: image → one–two sentences of trivia + a `#hashtag` line. |
| `CaptionBehavior` / `TypewriterText` | Lays caption text under the picture and types/edits it (delete‑then‑type diffs, keeping the hashtag suffix fixed). |
| `CardBackdrop` / `CardBackdropController` / `PlaneRect` | The rounded‑rect card border: flowing rainbow while capturing → cross‑fade to topic color (or white). See `CardBackdrop/README.md` for the shader graph. |

### Interests & topics

`TopicSelectionPanel` builds a honeycomb of Spectacles‑UI‑Kit capsule buttons and commits the selection to `InterestStore` (`global.cropInterestStore`). `InterestTopics` holds the preset `DEFAULT_TOPICS` — Art History, Chemistry, Biology, Botany, Physics, Space, Music, History, Food, Design, Trains, Aviation, XR. `TopicColors` is the single source of truth for topic→color (stable hashed fallback for unknown topics); `TopicFromText` maps a caption's first hashtag back to a preset topic.

### Recommendations

After Start, `RecommendationCards` (`global.recommendationCards`) flies in three `PremadeCard` sneak‑peeks of nearby places to visit; selecting one (by pinch or via `RecommendationVoiceAgent`) eases it to center, dissipates the rest, and spawns a **head‑locked AR arrow** that points toward a world‑fixed heading with a distance readout, then fades.

### Discovery & cards in the world

| Script | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `PrayerGestureBehavior` | Detects the palms‑together pose, sets `global.worldDiscovered`, fires the ping. |
| `PingController` | Expanding spherical "ping" shells via a graph shader on the World Mesh (`pingData`, `pingBrightness`, `bandThickness`, `trailLength`, `trailFalloff`, `maxRadius`, `pingColor`); cm units. |
| `WorldMeshFallback` | Ping renders on live World Mesh, or a ground‑plane quad when reconstruction isn't available. |
| `PingCardSpawner` | Reveals location‑filtered `PremadeCard`s exactly as the wavefront reaches each (reveal time = distance ÷ ping speed); cards open on gaze. |
| `Bubbles/*` | The morph system every card and the agent ring build on: `BubbleMesh` (blob↔rounded‑rect Perlin morph), `BubbleMeshBuilder` (hollow‑band mesh), `ShapeGeometry`, `PerlinNoise`, `BubbleField`. |
| `PremadeCard/*` | The card visual: `PremadeCard` (image + caption inside a morphing bubble border), `CardCaption` (text layout), `CardMorph` (pure 0→1 morph timeline). |
| `CardButtons/*` | The per‑card social rail — profile / like / comment / share / delete — with `ShareDrawer` (share‑to row), `CardButtonFactory`, and `CardButtonHost` (adapts captured vs premade cards). "Comment" engages Momo on that card. |

### Cards, cosmos & query

`CardStore` (`global.cropCardStore`) holds every card — the premade seed and this session's captures. `cardDeckData` authors the **37 premade "cosmos" cards** (20 Tokyo + 17 Seattle), each with real trivia text, topics, location, and date. `CardDeckController` spawns the cosmos as a head‑wrapping cylinder of always‑expanded cards laid out by relevance, folds captured cards in as the store grows, and — in query mode — fans matches into an iPod‑style CoverFlow deck you scrub through.

### Interactive globe → city map

A guided state machine takes you from a full Earth globe to a pannable street map and back: **OVERVIEW → ZOOMING_IN → DOCKED (L0..Ln) → ZOOMING_OUT → OVERVIEW**, math‑aligned so the globe→table handoff matches by construction.

| Script | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `GlobeController` | The state machine + input router (SIK pinch‑select / one‑hand pan / two‑hand zoom, plus touch). Drives the "dive" where the globe rotates a city up, slides it onto the table center, scales until its footprint matches the table, and fades out. Exposes `focusCityByName()` for the query agent. |
| `GlobeView` | Rotate‑to‑aim / scale‑to‑zoom Earth sphere, per‑channel pose tweening, self‑righting spring, material‑clone fading. |
| `MapViewport` | The holodeck table: UV pan/zoom under a fixed feathered crop, dual‑sampler LOD crossfades, live dive‑handoff framing. Material graph exposes `mapTex` / `uvOffset` / `uvScale`. |
| `CityData` + `cityBounds` (`.json` → generated `.ts`) | Binds per‑city LOD bounds to imported textures. Ships **Tokyo, Seattle, Los Angeles**, each L0 (0.45°) / L1 (0.14°) / L2 (0.045°) plus a wide L‑1 (4.5°) dive‑handoff capture. |
| `CityMarker` / `CardMarkerLayer` | Invisible per‑city selection targets, and the visible textured markers — one per `CardStore` card, scattered around its city, merged when close, clipped to the table circle, re‑mapped onto whichever surface is showing. |
| `CardGeo` / `GeoMath` | Pure, engine‑free math (trivially testable): UV ↔ sphere, easing, bounds↔UV, footprint matching; deterministic id‑seeded scatter, on‑land rejection sampling (`waterMask`), and in‑scene clustering that never merges across cities. |
| `GpsPingLayer` | A surface‑aligned GPS icon (default Los Angeles) that tracks the globe/table like the markers do. |
| `PinchDragTracker` | Jitter‑filtered drag deltas (wraps SIK's `OneEuroFilter`). |

Street imagery is **baked offline** by `tools/generate_map_textures.py` from OpenStreetMap tiles; that tool is the single source of truth for `cityBounds.json` (and the generated `cityBounds.ts` mirror), so capture framing can't drift from in‑lens alignment.

### Battle mode

`MultiplayerTriviaManager` (SpectaclesSyncKit) runs the two‑player game host‑authoritatively. Questions are built from **both players' cards**, and each question carries its own `roast` (spoken on a miss) and `praise` (on a correct answer) inline in the synced JSON.

**Where questions come from**, in priority order:

| Priority | Source | How |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Captured cards (both players) | `BattleQuestionGenerator` turns each device's session captures (from `global.cropCardStore`, `premade === false`) into questions via one **OpenAI gpt‑4o** call per batch of 8. The guest ships its results to the host (`QADD` / `QDONE`); the host **round‑robin interleaves** both players' captures so they alternate fairly. |
| 2 | Premade "cosmos" deck | The host fills the rest from the **baked** `PREMADE_QUESTIONS` (shuffled, batch of 12) — instant, no API call. The queue tops up from this pool if a long match runs dry. |
| 3 (fallback) | Snap Cloud / Supabase | Only if the queue *and* the baked pool are exhausted does the host call `fetchAndSync()` — an emergency POST to the Snap Cloud edge function (`functionName`, e.g. `random-trivia-object-topic`, with `topic`/`object`) via `SnapCloudRequirements`. Those rows have no inline roast, so the curated host bank covers them. |

The host assembles the queue during the countdown (captured first, then premade); an 8‑second deadline assembles with whatever has arrived so slow generation never stalls the start.

**The host voice.** `BattleHostVoice` (`global.battleHostVoice`) is an audio‑only Gemini Live narrator — **per‑device and unsynced**, so each player hears commentary about *their own* play. The manager calls `beginMatch()` on the first question, `speakQuestion()` to read it aloud, `stopQuestionRead()` the instant the local player buzzes, then a single outcome line: the question's own `praise`/`roast` wins, falling back to the curated `BattleHostLines` bank only when the question carries none (e.g. a Supabase fallback row) — momentum swings (`TAKE_LEAD` / `FALL_BEHIND` / `BLOWOUT_*`), `FAST_CORRECT` / `CORRECT` / `WRONG` / `TOO_SLOW`, `PRE_MATCHPOINT`, and `WIN` / `LOSS`. `BattleHostLines` is the Gemini‑free line bank with intensity calibration and the guardrail that a player who is behind is never roasted; `BattleHostVoice` reads each line verbatim via a `SAY:` marker at `temperature: 0`.

#### Networking & flow (SpectaclesSyncKit)

All synced state lives in one host‑owned `SyncEntity` (`triviaGameState`), created **unowned** (`claimOwnership = false`): with ownership, the store would belong to whichever device built it first — a race unrelated to the session host, which could leave a non‑owning host unable to write (e.g. the ready count stuck). Unowned lets the host's writes always propagate, and since only the host writes synced props there's no conflict. The host is the sole writer; the guest communicates via `session.sendMessage()`. Buzz timestamps use the **server clock** with a 0.5 s grace window so the genuinely‑earlier buzz wins despite network latency.

Synced properties: `jsonQuestion`, `roundState`, `currentActiveBuzzer`, `hostScore`, `guestScore`, `hostBuzzedTime`, `guestBuzzedTime`, `roundResult`, `winner`, `livePicks`, `gamePhase`, `readyCount`, `countdownStartToken`.

| Message | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GUEST_READY` | Guest → Host | Guest tapped Ready. |
| `GUEST_BUZZ:ts:optionIndex` | Guest → Host | Guest answered (server‑time + pick). |
| `QADD:<questionJson>` / `QDONE` | Guest → Host | Guest ships its card‑generated questions, then signals done. |
| `HOST_ROAST:questionId:inline` | Host → Guest | Cue the guest to render its already‑synced inline roast. |

**Phases** (synced via `gamePhase`): **LOBBY → COUNTDOWN → ACTIVE → GAMEOVER**. A deterministic lobby (a Ready button that swaps to "Waiting for Opponent," and an "X/2 Ready" status) replaces a race‑prone auto‑start, so both devices are joined and subscribed before the first question syncs. Once 2/2 ready, the host runs a synced 3‑2‑1 countdown and loads round one.

**Round rules (v3.0 — no per‑question timer):** a question ends only when one player answers correctly *or* both answer wrong. Correct = **+10**, wrong = **−5** (floored at 0); the first wrong answer opens a steal window for the opponent; if the steal also misses, both‑wrong reveals the correct answer (green button tint). Picks are surfaced the instant they're committed via `livePicks`, so each player's marker ("Me" above the button, "Opponent" below) and a green/red button tint appear on both devices immediately — even a wrong pick made while the steal window is open. The conclusion is published atomically in one `roundResult` prop so the phrase and markers never render half‑synced. First to `winScore` (default **30**) wins; "Matchpoint!" shows when a player is one correct answer away.

## Data sources

- **Remote Service Gateway (RSG)** — the model backend. It carries **Gemini Live** (Momo and the battle host), **OpenAI vision** (`ChatGPT` captioning), and **OpenAI gpt‑4o** (`BattleQuestionGenerator`), plus Snap services. Tokens live in `Assets/Scene.scene` and are scrubbed on commit (see Setup).
- **Card deck** — the primary source of Battle questions: captured cards generated at runtime (gpt‑4o) plus baked `PremadeQuestions.ts` for the cosmos deck. Each question carries its own roast and praise inline.
- **Snap Cloud / Supabase** — an **emergency fallback** question source. `MultiplayerTriviaManager` reaches it through a `SnapCloudRequirements` component (Supabase project URL + headers) and POSTs to the edge function set by **Function Name** (e.g. `random-trivia-object-topic`), filtered by **Topic** / **Object**; it's only called if the card‑driven queue and the baked pool are both exhausted.
- **OpenStreetMap** — map tiles consumed **offline** by `tools/generate_map_textures.py`; not fetched at runtime.

> **On Supabase / Snap Cloud (role).** Supabase is genuinely integrated in the project — `Assets/` holds a `SupabaseProject.supabaseProject` asset, Supabase‑generated `DatabaseTypes.ts`, and an `EdgeFunctionRoastById.ts` roast fetcher — but in the manager I reviewed (v3.0) it acts as a **fallback for questions**, not the live source. The match plays from the card‑driven queue (captured‑card questions via gpt‑4o, interleaved across both players, then baked premade questions); the host only calls `fetchAndSync()` when that queue and the baked pool run dry. Roasts are rendered **inline** from the synced question JSON (`HOST_ROAST` only cues the guest to show its already‑synced copy), so v3.0 doesn't reference `EdgeFunctionRoastById` — that fetcher appears to be from the earlier Supabase roast path and is either legacy or wired elsewhere; confirm against your build. The emergency question function accepts a POST with optional `object` / `topic` and returns:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "record": {
    "id": 42,
    "question": "What is the capital of France?",
    "option1": "London", "option2": "Paris", "option3": "Berlin", "option4": "Madrid",
    "optionCount": 4,
    "answer": 2
  }
}
```

The manager binds `record` to the `Question` text and the four option buttons and scores against `answer`.

### Battle question format

Both baked and generated questions share one shape (the manager assigns the `id` at queue‑assembly time):

```json
{
  "question": "What famous statue gets its green color from the same process that greens old copper roofs?",
  "option1": "Michelangelo's David",
  "option2": "The Lincoln Memorial",
  "option3": "The Statue of Liberty",
  "option4": "Mount Rushmore",
  "optionCount": 4,
  "answer": 3,
  "roast": "Green with envy at the folks who got that one?",
  "praise": "Correct — you've got an eye for green."
}
```

`answer` is the 1‑based index of the correct option. `BattleQuestionGenerator` requests this JSON from gpt‑4o (one call per batch of 8 cards) and drops malformed entries; `PremadeQuestions` ships the same shape pre‑authored.

---

## Setup

### Clone (Git LFS)

The full project uses [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com) for binary assets and packages. Install it before cloning:

```bash
git lfs install
git clone <repo-url>
```

### RSG credentials (important)

`RemoteServiceGatewayCredentials` stores its API tokens (OpenAI, Google, Snap) inline in `Assets/Scene.scene`. A **git clean filter** replaces the token values with placeholders on every commit while your local copy keeps the real ones. The filter is declared in `.gitattributes` but configured in `.git/config` (not part of the repo), so after cloning run once:

```bash
git config filter.rsgtokens.clean ".gitfilters/scrub-rsg-tokens.sh"
git config filter.rsgtokens.smudge cat
```

> ⚠️ Commit `Assets/Scene.scene` **without** the filter configured and your real tokens go in as plaintext.

Then open the project, select `RemoteServiceGatewayCredentials`, and paste your own tokens (OpenAI + Google/Gemini + Snap) into the inspector.

### Prerequisites

- [Lens Studio](https://ar.snap.com/lens-studio) with Spectacles support
- SpectaclesInteractionKit (SIK) + Spectacles UI Kit + RemoteServiceGateway + **SpectaclesSyncKit** packages
- RSG credentials for OpenAI (vision + gpt‑4o) + Google (Gemini Live) + Snap
- (Optional) a **Snap Cloud / Supabase** project with the emergency trivia edge function (`random-trivia-object-topic`), reached via a `SnapCloudRequirements` component — only hit as a fallback
- A separate `DynamicAudioOutput` per voice (welcome / nudge / recommendation / card / query / battle host) to avoid audio conflicts
- Python 3 (only to regenerate map textures)

### Regenerating map textures

```bash
python tools/generate_map_textures.py
```

`cityBounds.json` is the single source of truth; the tool re‑bakes the per‑city LOD PNGs from OpenStreetMap tiles and rewrites the generated `cityBounds.ts`. Hand‑edit the JSON and re‑run the tool rather than editing the `.ts`. Assign the generated PNGs to the per‑city texture arrays on `CityData` (L0..Ln order, plus the wide L‑1 handoff capture).

### Component setup references

- **Agent ring visuals** — `Scripts/AgentVisual/README.md`.
- **Card border shader** — `Scripts/CardBackdrop/README.md` (exposes `baseColor` + `reveal`).
- **Bubble morph system** — `Scripts/Bubbles/README.md`.
- **Globe/map** — `Scripts/Globe/README.md` (LOD bounds, dive handoff, map material graph).
- **Battle host** — needs the shared *Websocket requirements* object and its own `DynamicAudioOutput`; pick a voice (Charon, Puck, …). `BattleQuestionGenerator` only needs the OpenAI RSG token (same as `ChatGPT`).
- **Multiplayer trivia** — `MultiplayerTriviaManager` wires the `Question` text, four `CapsuleButton` options (+ optional child‑text name), the score/status/response/roast texts, the `Ready`/`Waiting` `RoundButton`s + ready‑status + countdown texts, the answer‑marker offset/size, and correct/incorrect button colors. Optional inputs: `BattleQuestionGenerator` (captured‑card questions — unassigned just uses baked premade), `BattleHostVoice` (the host — game runs fine without it), and `SnapCloudRequirements` + **Function Name** / **Topic** / **Object** for the emergency Supabase fallback. `winScore` defaults to 30.

### On‑device only

Gemini Live runs over a gateway WebSocket and **does not work in the Lens Studio simulator**. Use Preview with a device (Device Type Override = Spectacles) or run on Spectacles, online. For two‑player testing across different Snapchat accounts, set the same **Developer Settings → Skip Session Selection** password on both devices.

## Lessons learned

**RSG keeps only the newest session alive.** Two simultaneous Gemini Live sessions blank the device, so the voices enforce a single live session and hand the slot off explicitly (`suspend()` / `engage()`), polling each other's `isActive()` before connecting.

**The shared mic is destructive and can latch dead.** Every recorder points at one `MicrophoneAudioProvider`; `getAudioFrame()` drains the frame, and a failed `start()` near launch can leave the provider "started‑but‑dead." Always cycle stop→start, acquire exclusively, and watchdog‑recover.

**Drive the audio envelope by playback time, not frame arrival.** Gemini bursts seconds of PCM up front; scheduling frames by their real playback duration keeps the orb (and subtitle reveal) synced to what's audible.

**To make a Live model *read* instead of *chat*, command it.** Sending a line as a plain user turn made Gemini reply to it. Wrapping each line in a `SAY:` marker at `temperature: 0` with a strict "perform this verbatim" instruction turns it into a faithful TTS performer with the guardrails intact.

**Separate the "brain" from the "voice."** `BattleHostLines`, `TopicAgentTools`, `QueryOrchestrator`, and `CardEditTools` hold the deterministic, model‑free logic; the agent components own only the live session. The logic stays trivially testable and the agents stay about the session.

**Bake what never changes; generate only what's personal.** The 37 fixed cosmos cards ship pre‑authored questions (instant, free, reliable); only user‑captured cards pay for an OpenAI call — same question shape either way.

**Clone materials before modifying them.** The globe, map, card borders, bubbles, and agent ring all clone their base material and override color/alpha/blend on the clone, so shared assets are never mutated.

**Keep placement math pure and deterministic.** `GeoMath` / `CardGeo` / `ShapeGeometry` / `CardMorph` have no engine dependencies, and every card scatter is seeded by the card id — so markers are testable and never drift between frames, zooms, or sessions.

**Match the globe→table handoff by footprint span.** The dive aligns the globe and the flat map by making their on‑screen footprints equal at the crossover, so the swap reads as detail sharpening rather than a jump.

**Create the sync store *unowned*.** SpectaclesSyncKit assigns store ownership to whichever device constructs it first — a race unrelated to the session host. A guest‑owned store silently drops the host's writes (e.g. the ready count never updates). Creating the `SyncEntity` with `claimOwnership = false` lets every device send/receive, and since only the host writes synced props, the host's writes always land with no conflict.

**Rank buzzes on the server clock, with a grace window.** Per‑device `Date.now()` isn't comparable across two phones. Using `getServerTimeInSeconds()` plus a short (0.5 s) wait after the first buzz lets the genuinely‑earlier buzz win even when its network message lands a little later.

**Publish a conclusion atomically.** Rendering a round's outcome from several separate synced props raced — players briefly saw "Too slow!" before the picks synced. Publishing the whole result in one `roundResult` string (and live picks in one `livePicks` string) makes the phrase and markers render together.

**A deterministic lobby beats a host auto‑start.** A Ready‑up phase that only fetches the first question once both players are 2/2 ready guarantees both devices are joined and subscribed before `jsonQuestion` syncs — fixing the empty/stuck first question when the second player joins.

**UIKit buttons must be enabled at startup to wire their handlers.** Their tap handler binds in `OnStartEvent`, which never fires for an object disabled at launch — so disabling a button at startup permanently breaks it. The lobby swaps in a pre‑styled "Waiting" button (and hides it one frame later) instead of restyling or pre‑disabling the original.
